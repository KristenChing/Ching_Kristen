A programming language is a language for computers that computers use to communicate with the user. Python is 
one of many programming languages. Programming languages use source code and/or assembly code, which are translated 
into machine code, which the computer understands. There are two types of programming languages: interpreted
languages and compiled languages. Compiler languages translate source code into machine code before it is run. On
the other hand, interpreted languages translate source code into machine code as the program is running. These two
types have different purposes and have their own stengths/weaknesses. Python is a complied language and an 
interpretive language because it contains characteristics of both types. This is because it converts source code
into bytecode rather than machine code, then converts the bytecode to machine code while it runs. Print statements
can be created in Python in the format of print("statement") which is a built-in Python function. When print
statements are run, they will "print" or return in the running window whatever you told it to print.
