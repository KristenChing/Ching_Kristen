	<h3><a name = "Section 1"></a>Basic Stuff</h3>
	<h5>First, in order to create a website, you have to define a file as an HTML. In the basics of HTML code, all commands are within <>, which are called tags. In order to call a command, you would have to put it within tags and to close it, put it within tags but with a slash after the opening tag. So to define a file as an HTML, you type < ! doctype html >. </br></br>
	The basic commands are < html >, < body >, and < head >, which define the parts of the website. The head contains "hidden" content and the body contains the main content which will be seen by the viewer. You can also add a title, which is the tab name.</h5>
	<hr/>
	<h3><a name = "Section 2"</a>Print formatting</h3>
	<h5>HTML does not show returns/tabs and will print stuff all in one line. Which is why the < p > exists, because it is for creating a new paragraph! You can also use < /br > to create linebreaks. Additional ways to edit text are < strong > (bold) and < em > (italicize).
	Font sizes have a range from  < h1 > to < h5 >, < h1 > being the largest and  < h5 > being the smallest.</h5> 
	<hr/>
	<h3><a name = "Section 3"</a>Other Commands</h3>
	<h5><ul>
	<li>comments look like this: < !--this is a comment-- > </br></li>
	<li>a horizontal line: < hr/ >. </br></li>
	<li>links are added using < a href = link address >a link< /a >
	<a href = "http://tpprogramming.blogspot.com/p/cplesson.html" title = "Mr. Robinette's Website">Here is a link to a website.</a></br></li>
	<li>creating section titles: The identifier name is used so it can be linked to from other links.</br></li>
	<li>linking to other sections: < a href = #"identifier name" >name< /a > </br></li>
	<li>adding images: < img src = "imagename" height = 0 width = 0 ></br></li>
	<li>link titles: < a href = "site address" title = "link title" >link name< /a ></li>
	</ul></h5><hr/>
	<h3><a name = "Section 4"</a>Tables</h3>
	<h5>
	Basically to create a table you write < table >.
	Inside the table you can have table rows, < tr >, and inside each < tr > you have < td >, which is table data.
	A table border is created using < table border = "num" >, which creates a border around the table, and 1 px lines dividing values.
	We can also add images and links inside of our table. </br></br>
	We can create headers for our table by using < th >, which stands for table header, inside of our < td > 's. We can also have an empty cell just by typing < td >< /td > The table header is automatically bolded so we don't have to bold it.
	In addition, we can add a title for the whole table, which is done inside a table header tag: < th colspan = "num" >Title< /th > 
	We can adjust the height and width of our table using percentages so that it will take up that portion of the table. This can be done inside of a th tag or inside of the entire table tag.
	Another thing that is useful is cellpadding (cellpadding = ""). This is the space between the text and the cell border (pixels), and is set inside of the table tag.
	Lastly, cellspacing (cellspacing = "") adjusts the thickness of the borders that separate the cells.
	</h5><hr/>
	<h3><a name = "Section 5"</a>Lists</h3>
	<h5>
	Lists: 
	<ol><li>ordered list. < ol ></li>
	<li>unordered list. < ul ></li></ol>
	What's the difference? An ordered list contains numbers.
	List items: < li >
	</h5>
	<hr/>
	<h3><a name = "Section 6"</a>CSS</h3>
	<h5>
	Basically cool font stuff. Colors, font, etc. 
	< style type = "text/css" > <-- activates CSS. MUST be in the head.
	ex. p {color:blue;font-family:arial} - this changes paragraph text so that the words in the paragraph are blue and in arial font.
	You can also just use RGB values. This works the same way for editing spacing, such as line-height:0% Whatever you are editing, in this case, p , the paragraph text, is called the element. The property is what you are changing about the element text. (color, font, etc.) You can even edit the entire body element. </br></br>
	CSS properties:
	<ul>
	<li>{color#000000;}</li>
	<li>{line-height:num%;} (spacing) </li>
	<li>{font-weight: bold;}</li>
	<li>{font-style:italic;}</li>
	<li>{font-family:arial}</li>
	<li>{text-align:center;}</li>
	<li>{text-indent:0px;}</li>
	<li>{background-color:blue;} (this must be done in the body)</li>
	<li>{background-image:url(nameoffile.png);} ("tiles" itself in background)</li>
	<li>{background-repeat:no-repeat;} (and then it will "no tile")</li>
	<li>{background-repeat:repeat-x;} (row)</li>
	<li>{background-repeat:repeat-y;} (colomn)</li>
	<li>{background-position: 0px 2px} (x y from top left corner/can also be done with percentages)</li>
	</ul></h5>
	</body>
