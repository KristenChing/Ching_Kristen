	<h3><a name = "Section 1"></a>Basic Stuff</h3>
	First, in order to create a website, you have to define a file as an HTML. In the basics of HTML code, all commands are within <>, which are called tags. In order to call a command, you would have to put it within tags and to close it, put it within tags but with a slash after the opening tag. So to define a file as an HTML, you type < ! doctype html >. </br></br>
	The basic commands are < html >, < body >, and < head >, which define the parts of the website. The head contains "hidden" content and the body contains the main content which will be seen by the viewer. You can also add a title, which is the tab name.
	<hr/>
	<h3><a name = "Section 2"</a>Print formatting</h3>
	HTML does not show returns/tabs and will print stuff all in one line. Which is why the < p > exists, because it is for creating a new paragraph! You can also use < /br > to create linebreaks. Additional ways to edit text are < strong > (bold) and < em > (italicize).
	Font sizes have a range from  < h1 > to < h5 >, < h1 > being the largest and  < h5 > being the smallest. 
	<hr/>
	<h3><a name = "Section 3"</a>Other Commands</h3>
	- comments look like this: < !--this is a comment-- > </br>
	- a horizontal line: < hr/ >. </br> 
	- links are added using < a href = link address >a link< /a >
	<a href = "http://tpprogramming.blogspot.com/p/cplesson.html" title = "Mr. Robinette's Website">Here is a link to a website.</a></br>
	- creating section titles: The identifier name is used so it can be linked to from other links.</br>
	- linking to other sections: < a href = #"identifier name" >name< /a > </br>
	- adding images: < img src = "imagename" height = 0 width = 0 ></br>
	- link titles: < a href = "site address" title = "link title" >link name< /a >
	<hr/>
	<h3><a name = "Section 4"</a>Tables</h3>
	Basically to create a table you write < table >.
	Inside the table you can have table rows, < tr >, and inside each < tr > you have < td >, which is table data.
	A table border is created using < table border = "num" >, which creates a border around the table, and 1 px lines dividing values.
	We can also add images and links inside of our table. </br></br>
	We can create headers for our table by using < th >, which stands for table header, inside of our < td > 's. We can also have an empty cell just by typing < td >< /td > The table header is automatically bolded so we don't have to bold it.
	In addition, we can add a title for the whole table, which is done inside a table header tag: < th colspan = "num" >Title< /th > 
	We can adjust the height and width of our table using percentages so that it will take up that portion of the table. This can be done inside of a th tag or inside of the entire table tag.
	Another thing that is useful is cellpadding (cellpadding = ""). This is the space between the text and the cell border (pixels), and is set inside of the table tag.
	Lastly, cellspacing (cellspacing = "") adjusts the thickness of the borders that separate the cells.
