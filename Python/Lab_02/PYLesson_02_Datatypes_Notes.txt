Like in math, programming uses variables. However, variables in python work differently than the variables you 
use in math. In programming variables can be set to a certain value and changed and be used in math operations.
Variables can also be set to strings instead of numbers. A string is a "string" of text (usually words, etc.)
The "numbers" are a datatype known as integers. Strings and integers can be converted between each other using
the str() and int() commands. Other datatypes include floats (decimal numbers), lists ex. blah = ["str", "str", "str"]
used for containing a set of information (strings or integers), and tuples (unmodifiable lists that use parentheses
instead of square brackets). Variable names are case-sensitive and cannot begin with a number or underscore. It
also cannot be the name of anything else, ex. you cannot name a variable print because it will think you are trying
to use the print function. Variables can be printed using the print command. Like earlier mentioned, variables can
also be used in arithmetic operations, +, * (multiplication), etc. Strings can also be added like numbers. Strings
and integers can also be combined (ex. in a print statement).
