When you make a variable make user that your code is easy to read. Python
has a lot of built in functions that we call by typing them. One of these built in
functions is the input() function whose format is variable = input("type something here")
This sets the variable value to whatever you typed in response to the prompt "type something
here." If you print the variable it will print whatever you typed in response to 
the prompt. Anything you enter into an input() function will default be a string, even if
you type in a number which is why you have to convert it to an integer (well, that's
only if you need it to be an integer and you need to add it or something) using the 
int() function. You can also convert it back using the str() function which pretty
much does the same thing only it converts it to a string. 

(A variant function on input() is raw_input()).
