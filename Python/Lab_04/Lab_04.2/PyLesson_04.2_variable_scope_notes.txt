Sometimes when you are working with code you will come across an error that says something like
"Blah blah blah is not a global variable" or something like that. What does that mean? A global
variable is a variable that can be accessed from anywhere in your code. This usually occurs when
you have defined variables at the very top of your page that are not inside of any functions. You
might be wondering, well then when is a variable not global? The best example of this is a variable
found inside of a function. In-function variables can only be accessed from inside a function. So what
are these variables called? They are called "out of scope" based on what is out of scope. For
example, if you have two functions called function1 and function2, and function1 contains variable1
and function2 contains variable2 (very generic names, I know), then function1 cannot access variable2
and function2 cannot access variable1 and this is called function2 being out of variable1's scope.
The scope (of a varaible) is the area of (code) in which a variable can be accessed. If you are
going to need to be continually doing the same thing over and over in your code, it is a good idea
to make functions for it! (That way you can spare yourself the amount of time it takes to type
stuff, plus typing lots of stuff isn't necessarily convenient). You can also split different parts
that need to be done into separate functions, for example you can have two different functions for adding 
and displaying the sum. This way things can also be less complicated and it will be easier to find
mistakes in your code.
