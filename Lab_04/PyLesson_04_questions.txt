1a. How do you begin writing a program?
You can begin writing a program with either a text file and labeling it .py instead of .txt (or by opening Py IDLE and going to File>>new>>, but we aren't doing that in this class...)

1b. What does a program file consist of?
A program file consists of code. 

1c. Do you need fancy development software? Why?
Not necessarily.  You just need to have Python installed so your computer knows what language you are talking to it in. It also lets you save a .py file, whereas in the terminal it doesn't. (Or at least I don't think it does).

2a. Why does the method need to be at the top of most of the programs that we have created so far? 
Methods don't always have to be at the very top, but you need to have a method defined before you call it.

2b. How does Python run lines of code?
Python runs lines of code by converting it to bytecode, then converting the bytecode to machine code as it runs.

3a. Why do we need parameters?
We need parameters because otherwise your function will be confused and will not know what to do with the values that you give it.

3b. How do they enhance our use of methods?
They enhance our use of methods by making functions easy and convenient.

3c. What do they enable use to do? 
They enable us to be able to repeat things (over and over) with different inputs. (Speaking of doing things over and over, when are we learning 'while'??)

4. What is the difference between return methods and the other kind of method we used?
Return methods are more convenient and allow us to save the value of a function's output once it is called. That way it is already preset to a variable (calling the function acts as a variable) instead of having to set it to a separate variable and then printing it...
