Functions by default don't return values. This means that you don't have
to write print ("blah blah blah") inside of the function, you can just save
the value of the function's output. For example,

def meow(null):
	null +=1
	return null
	#print (null)

Another good reason to be doing this is because if you have a function where you
DON'T want it to print, you will not have a way to retrieve your output UNLESS
you use the return function. Otherwise, if you just run the function, it will NOT
output ANYTHING (even if you have called it.) Returning function output also makes
working with functions more flexible. The uses of the function output is not as limited
