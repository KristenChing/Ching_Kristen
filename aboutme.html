	<h3><a name = "Section 1"></a>Basic Stuff</h3>
	First, in order to create a website, you have to define a file as an HTML. In the basics of HTML code, all commands are within <>, which are called tags. In order to call a command, you would have to put it within tags and to close it, put it within tags but with a slash after the opening tag. (Which ends up sounding really complicated because I can't type an example without it being interpreted as code.) So to define a file as an HTML, you type < ! doctype html >. </br></br>
	The basic commands are html/body/head, which define the parts of the website. The head contains "hidden" content and the body contains the main content which will be seen by the viewer. You can also add a title, which is the tab name.
	<hr/>
	<h3><a name = "Section 2"</a>Print formatting</h3>
	HTML does not show returns/tabs and will print stuff all in one line. Which is why the p 'command' exists, because it is for creating a new paragraph! This is used in the same way as the title. As a result, each sentence appears on a new line. However, you can also use /br to create linebreaks. Additional ways to edit text are strong (bold) and em (italicize).
	Font sizes have a range from h1 to h5, h1 being the largest and h5 being the smallest. 
	<hr/>
	<h3><a name = "Section 3"</a>Other Commands</h3>
	- comments are added using an exclamation point followed by two dashes on both sides inside a pair of tags. </br>
	- a horizontal line is created using hr/. </br> 
	- links are added using a (which stands for 'anchor'), followed by href =, then the link address and link name.
	<a href = "Mr. Robinette's Computer Programming Class_ WEBLesson_01.html">Here is a link to a website.</a></br>
	- creating section titles: font size, followed by name =, identifier name, followed by actual name. The identifier name is used so it can be linked to from other links.</br>
	- linking to other sections: a, href =, "# identifier name" </br>
	- adding images img src = "imagename" height = 0 width = 0 </br>
	- link titles: a href = "sitename" title = "link title" link name
