	<h3><a name = "Section 1"></a>Basic Stuff</h3>
	First, in order to create a website, you have to define a file as an HTML. In the basics of HTML code, all commands are within <>, which are called tags. In order to call a command, you would have to put it within tags and to close it, put it within tags but with a slash after the opening tag. So to define a file as an HTML, you type < ! doctype html >. </br></br>
	The basic commands are < html >, < body >, and < head >, which define the parts of the website. The head contains "hidden" content and the body contains the main content which will be seen by the viewer. You can also add a title, which is the tab name.
	<hr/>
	<h3><a name = "Section 2"</a>Print formatting</h3>
	HTML does not show returns/tabs and will print stuff all in one line. Which is why the < p > exists, because it is for creating a new paragraph! This is used in the same way as the title. You can also use < /br > to create linebreaks. Additional ways to edit text are < strong > (bold) and < em > (italicize).
	Font sizes have a range from  < h1 > to < h5 >, < h1 > being the largest and  < h5 > being the smallest. 
	<hr/>
	<h3><a name = "Section 3"</a>Other Commands</h3>
	- comments look like this: < !---this is a comment--- > </br>
	- a horizontal line is created using < hr/ >. </br> 
	- links are added using < a href = link address >a link< /a >
	<a href = "Mr. Robinette's Computer Programming Class_ WEBLesson_01.html">Here is a link to a website.</a></br>
	- creating section titles: font size, followed by name =, identifier name, followed by actual name. The identifier name is used so it can be linked to from other links.</br>
	- linking to other sections: a, href =, "# identifier name" </br>
	- adding images img src = "imagename" height = 0 width = 0 </br>
	- link titles: a href = "sitename" title = "link title" link name
